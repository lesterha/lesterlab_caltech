<p class="p1">&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;big&gt;About the simulation&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Legend to the simulation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plots give simulations of nicotine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics during smoking. At left, the pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic model, implemented in Matlab SimBiology. Individual parameters and structures, and smoking dosages are presented in Supplemental Table 2 and in the Supplemental ZIP File of (Shivange et al., 2019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “reset” button reverts the simulation to the “standard event”. This is a common pattern of smoking: 1 cigarette, yielding 1 mg of ingested nicotine, each h, for 12 h during each day, elimination rate constant kel 0.706 L/h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At right, top. Nicotine concentrations in the plasma / CSF / ER, and in the “sequestered” compartment. The “sequestered” compartment was termed the “peripheral compartment” by (Benowitz et al., 1991), but that terminology is less preferable in discussions of the nervous system. Note the logarithmic [nicotine] scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At right, bottom. Effects on the two processes shown at left. Note that the “standard habit” activates nAChR protein chaperoning (inside-out process) &gt; 50%, but this activates nAChR channel activation (outside-in process) &lt; 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This app is a slightly modified, interactive version of Figure 8 in (Shivange et al, 2019). The original simulations were performed by Janice Jeon, then a Caltech undergrad, in the Matlab SimBiology Toolbox. In 2020, Dr. Fulden Fulden Buyukozturk (The Mathworks) adapted the simulations to a Matlab Web App, with advice from Suresh Balakrishnama of The Mathworks. At Caltech, Alexander Wang, a Caltech undergrad, installed the app on a Windows 10 and modified the user interface further, based on suggestions from Henry Lester’s research group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lightning scientific summary: subcellular and macroscopic pharmacokinetics of nicotine.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modified from the abstract of (Shivange et al., 2019). Nicotine dependence is thought to arise in part because nicotine permeates into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it binds to nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) and begins an “inside-out” pathway that leads to upregulation of nAChRs on the plasma membrane. However until 2019, the dynamics of nicotine entry into the ER were not quantified. This problem was solved with a series of genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors for nicotine, termed iNicSnFRs. In several cell types, we find that nicotine equilibrates in the ER within 10 s (possibly within 1 s) of extracellular application, and leaves as rapidly after removal from the extracellular solution. The [nicotine] in the ER is within two-fold of the extracellular value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The app uses these data to run combined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic simulations of human smoking. In the ER, the inside-out pathway begins when nicotine becomes a stabilizing pharmacological chaperone for some nAChR subtypes, even at concentrations as low as ~ 10 nM. Such concentrations would persist during the 12 h of a typical smoker’s day, continually activating the inside-out pathway by &gt; 75%. Reducing nicotine intake by 10-fold decreases activation to ~ 20%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Additional details: the outside-in and inside-out pathways during smoking&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data (Shivange et al., 2019) generated two insights important for understanding the inside-out pathway. 1, The genetically encoded nicotine biosensors targeted to the ER reveal that nicotine appears in the ER within ≤ 10 s after it appears in the extracellular solution. The delay may be as small as 1 s. 2, After this delay, the [nicotine] in the ER differs by less than two-fold from [nicotine] in the extracellular solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most complete data on pharmacological chaperoning have utilized extracellular application of nicotine, applied for several h (Kuryatov et al., 2005). Therefore, a major question arising from previous data was whether nicotine enters the ER quickly enough to serve as a pharmacological chaperone. The answer, based on (Shivange et al., 2019), is clearly, “yes.” When nicotine is removed from the extracellular solution, nicotine leaves the ER, again within 10 s. If [nicotine] in the ER drops below the EC50 for pharmacological chaperoning during the interval between cigarettes, then the inside-out pathway cannot readily account for nicotine dependence. We term this point the “rapid exit” problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simulation addresses the “rapid exit” problem by using existing data on the pharmacokinetics of nicotine during smoking. After a person receives a bolus of nicotine from a cigarette or an ENDS, [nicotine] in the body decreases with two exponential terms. During the slower phase, measurable nicotine endures in the plasma for several h (Benowitz et al., 1991). The app simulates fractional activation of the inside-out and outside-in pathways using the available data from the literature (Benowitz et al., 1991; Kuryatov et al., 2005; Rollema et al., 2007).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the highly nicotine-sensitive feature of pharmacological chaperoning, [nicotine] in the ER remains greater than the EC50 for pharmacological chaperoning during the entire 1 h interval between cigarettes in the “standard habit”. The inside-out pathway remains &gt; 50% activated continually during the 12 h of the “standard habit” (lower panel). We concluded that the inside-out pathway, operating via pharmacological chaperoning, can readily account for upregulation, an important component of nicotine dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Acute,’ ‘repeated’ and ‘chronic’ exposure to nicotine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Shivange, 2019) remarked, “Our simulations also lead one to re-examine the relationship between the previously distinct concepts of ‘acute,’ ‘repeated’” and ‘chronic’ exposure to nicotine. In the ‘standard habit,’ even a single cigarette, whose nicotine is fully ingested during 10 min, activates the inside-out pathway &gt; 50% until the next cigarette one h later. Thus, a series of ‘acute’ and ‘repeated’ exposures, one/hr for 12 h, becomes “chronic” activation for the 12 h of smoking activity. By the next morning, nicotine levels have decreased below levels that activate pharmacological chaperoning; but the downstream trafficking and subsequent sequelae, including nAChR upregulation, probably endure for several d (Marks et al., 1985).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Thus, subcellular pharmacokinetics readily explains dependence on smoked nicotine. Around the world at any time, several hundred million people have ingested tobacco within the past h; they retain nicotine in every organelle of every cell. In the ER and cis-Golgi of the small percentage of cells that contain α4β2 nAChRs, these levels activate the inside-out pathway &gt; 50%, and therefore maintain one aspect of nicotine dependence.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Quantitative aspects of reducing nicotine levels&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shivange at also noted, “the prominence of the inside-out pathway in nicotine dependence has prompted us to simulate the activation of the inside-out pathway, as well as the outside-in pathway, during use of modified tobacco or ENDS (Table 1 of Shivange, 2019). United States FDA officials recently suggested decreasing the nicotine content of combustible tobacco. Our simulations show that a three-fold reduction would nonetheless provide &gt; 40% average activation of the inside-out pathway; a ten-fold reduction (to 0.1 mg/cigarette) would reduce average activation to 20%. This conclusion would also hold for ingestion via an edlectronic nicotinic delivery system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fast and slow metabolizers: the “elimination parameter”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “standard habit” simulates a “typical” smoker (Benowitz et al., 1991), summarized by the “elimination parameter”. Increasing the “elimination parameter”, decreases the lifetime of nicotine in the blood / CSF / ER compartment. Polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 2A6, the enzyme that primarily metabolizes nicotine, lead to dramatic (up to 10-fold) differences in nicotine lifetime among people (Dempsey et al., 2004). Fast and slow metabolizers display differences in the frequency of smoking (Tanner et al., 2015). Future investigations must simulate the consequences of these variations for activation of the inside-out pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Funding&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research and the development of this app was supported by grants from US National Institutes of Health (DA036061, DA037161, DA043829, GM123582, GM007616, MH061876, NS097362, and NS034407), the California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Project (23XT-0007), the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (EDUC2-08398), the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (NARSAD), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Della Martin Foundation.
